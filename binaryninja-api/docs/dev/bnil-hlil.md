# Binary Ninja Intermediate Language Series, Part 3: High Level IL
# Binary Ninja Intermediate Language: High Level IL

The High Level Intermediate Language (HLIL) is Binary Ninja's decompiler output. Much like [LLIL](./bnil-llil.md) and [MLIL](./bnil-mlil.md), this representation is tree based and has many of the same instructions. This representation is distinct in a few key ways.

1. High level language concepts are recovered.
1. Expressions are folded

## Purposes of HLIL

* Simplified representation
* Small discrete operations
* EnablesÂ source-level forms of queries and analysis

In the rest of this article we will explore the instruction set.

## The Instruction Set

The instruction set is made up of [`HighLevelILInstruction`](https://api.binary.ninja/binaryninja.highlevelil-module.html#binaryninja.highlevelil.HighLevelILInstruction) objects. Let's start exploring by using the python console to poke around at some instructions. Open up a binary in Binary Ninja and retrieve an HLIL instruction:+

```
>>> current_il_instruction
<HighLevelILVarInit: uint64_t rax_2 = zx.q(rax_1 - 0x6c)>
>>> type(current_il_instruction)
<class 'binaryninja.highlevelil.HighLevelILVarInit'>
```

`current_il_instruction` is mapped to whatever il instruction is currently selected viewed and is not generally available to those writing plugins or scripts. You can see a full list of our [magic variables here](../guide/index.md#magic-console-variables).

There are a number of properties that can be queried on the [`HighLevelILInstruction`](https://api.binary.ninja/binaryninja.highlevelil-module.html#binaryninja.highlevelil.HighLevelILInstruction) object, and the validity of these properties changes depending on what the current operation is. The properties in HLIL are extremely similar to those in MLIL, with one notable exception being that `HLIL_CALL` instruction objects do not have a `.output` property, but instead `HLIL_CALL`s that have return values will be the `inst.right` of a `HighLevelILVarInit`, `HighLevelILVarAssign`, or similar.


### Control Flow

* `HLIL_JUMP` - Branch to the `dest` expression's address
* `HLIL_CALL` - Branch to the `dest` expression function, saving the return address, with the list of parameters `params`

* `HLIL_NORET` - This instruction will never be executed, the instruction before it is a call that doesn't return
* `HLIL_IF` - Branch to the `true`/`false` HLIL instruction identifier depending on the result of the `condition` expression
