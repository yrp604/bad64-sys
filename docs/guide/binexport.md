# BinExport / BinDiff

BinExport is a [plugin written by Google](https://github.com/google/binexport) (originally [Zynamics](https://www.zynamics.com/) before their acquisition) to create files used for the [BinDiff](https://github.com/google/bindiff) differential analysis tool.

## Usage

### Enable the Experimental Plugin

![BinExport Setting >](../img/binexport-setting.png "BinExport Setting"){ width="400" }

The initial release of this plugin is **EXPERIMENTAL** due to being finished too close to a stable release for better testing. As such, it is disabled by default. To enable it, search settings for "binexport", enable the plugin, and restart Binary Ninja.

### Activation

![BinExport Success >](../img/binexport-success.png "BinExport Success"){ width="300" }

To trigger the plugin and create a `.binexport` file for the current binary, use either the `Plugins` / `BinExport` menu, or the `BinExport` action in the [command-palette](./index.md#command-palette).

A file dialog will open, defaulting to the same file name and location (without the original file extension -- a new file extension will automatically be appended of .BinExport`)

If successful, two more dialogs will show up. One warning that the export can take some time for large files, and a second confirming success.

### What Next?

After creating the before and after `.BinExport` files you wish to analyze, you'll want to install [BinDiff](https://github.com/google/bindiff), and run it on the CLI or the GUI to create a `.bindiff` result database.

```sh
$ bindiff writable.BinExport writable2.BinExport
BinDiff 7 (@377901646, Jun  7 2021), (c)2004-2011 zynamics GmbH, (c)2011-2021 Google LLC.

```

The resulting `.BinDiff` file can either be opened in the BinDiff Java GUI, or directly in Binary Ninja directly using the [BD Viewer](https://github.com/PistonMiner/binaryninja-bindiff-viewer) plugin (available via the [Plugin Manager](./plugins.md)) and also supports porting symbols from one matched database to another.
